## Big Goals

- Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
- Use your programming skills to work out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
- Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
- Build an application to a specification that someone else gives you
- Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete from the same computer
- Craft a README.md file that explains your app to the world

## Technical Requirements
### Your Tic Tac Toe app must:

- Render a game board in the browser
- Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
- Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row, or show a draw if neither player wins
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- You can use GitHub Pages for deploying your project
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
- Have well-formatted, and well-commented code

### User Stories:

As a user, I should:
- be able to start a new tic tac toe game
- be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
- be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- not be able to click the same square twice
- be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
- be able to play the game again without refreshing the page

## README Suggestions

- List technologies used
- Link to wireframes and user stories.
- Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
- List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
- Describe how you solved for the winner
- Describe how some of your favorite functions work

## Submission

Create a new repository on your personal public GitHub account. Then, submit your project as an issue to interapt repo

You must turn in something before presentations begin. However, you're welcome to continue working on it over the course of SEI and beyond!

With your submission please include any questions you'd like answered, or specific things on which you'd like us to focus when giving feedback.
