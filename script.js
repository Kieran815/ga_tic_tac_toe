Render a game board in the browser
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row, or show a draw if neither player wins
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
You can use GitHub Pages for deploying your project
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
Have well-formatted, and well-commented code
